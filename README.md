js-extension-framework (JSEF)
=============================

A generic JavaScript extension framework.

JSEF POC #1 (ewittmann)
=======================
Just open up ewittmann/poc1/host-app.html in your browser.  Then take a look at
all the code.  This POC is designed to show the core concepts of JSEF: expose
extension points and contribute functionality to those extension-points.

This POC has a host application that exposes two extension points.  It also has
two app extensions that both contribute to those extension points.
